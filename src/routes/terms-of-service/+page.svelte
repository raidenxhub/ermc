        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By accessing and using the ERMC (Event Roster Management Control) website and services (accessible at ermc.realkenan.dev), you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement. In addition, when using these particular services, you shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services.
            Any participation in this service will constitute acceptance of this agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not use this service.
            This agreement is between you and ERMC. ERMC is an independent, third-party utility created for the benefit of the VATSIM community and is not officially affiliated with VATSIM Inc.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
            ERMC provides a web-based platform for flight simulation enthusiasts, specifically members of the VATSIM network, to coordinate air traffic control services, book rostering slots, and view event information.
            The service allows users to view upcoming events, claim ATC positions, coordinate with other controllers, and manage their roster commitments.
            The service is provided "as-is" and "as-available". ERMC assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery, or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time without notice.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>
            You agree to use the website only for lawful purposes related to flight simulation on the VATSIM network. You are prohibited from posting on or transmitting through the website any material that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, profane, hateful, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable.
        </p>
        <p>Specifically, you agree NOT to:</p>

            <li>Automate access to the site (e.g., via bots, scrapers, or scripts) without prior written permission from ERMC administration.</li>
            <li>Book ATC slots with no intention of staffing them ("slot blocking"), which disrupts event coordination for others.</li>
        </ul>
